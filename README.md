## 🔍 What Is a Division 2 Wallhack?

A **wallhack** (also known as ESP – Extra Sensory Perception) is a cheat that overlays real-time info onto your screen, showing you players, AI, items, and more through any surface. It’s not just visuals – you’ll know exact positions, distances, health, and even loadouts if the cheat supports it.

Whether you're storming a stronghold or sneaking in the Dark Zone, ESP turns you into a human radar system. 🎮🧬

## ⚠️ Safety & Detection Tips

* 👻 **Use in PvE to farm safely** – ESP is amazing for mission clearing
* 💀 **Be careful in Dark Zone** – If someone sees you pre-aiming, you’ll look sus
* 🔒 **Avoid free/public hacks** – They get detected fast
* 🧹 **Keep your tool updated** – Game updates break ESP offsets often
* 🛑 **Combine with Aimbot carefully** – Too accurate + ESP = instant red flag in PvP

ESP is often less risky than aimbots, but don’t go full rage unless you're spoofed and ready to burn an account.
